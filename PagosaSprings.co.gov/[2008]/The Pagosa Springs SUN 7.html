Dick will provide a plant list for the area. The program is free and is sponsored by the San Juan Mountains Association and San Juan National Forest.</font></p>

												<p><font size="2">David was born Sept. 2, 1923, in Pagosa Springs, Colo., to Louis J. and Hortense L. Goodman. He grew up in Pagosa Springs, enjoying the outdoors, mostly hunting, camping and fishing. He graduated from New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell, N.M. in 1943. Upon graduation, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served three years in the 148th Field Artillery Battalion, with duty in the South Pacific, the Philippines and Japan. Upon discharge, he returned to Pagosa Springs, where he managed Goodman’s Department Store and became the third generation owner until 1982, when he relinquished control of the store to his son, Robert P. Goodman.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">David is survived by his wife, Dorothy E. Goodman, of Tucson, Ariz.; children, Dorothy Louise Baltes (husband Thomas), of Albuquerque, N.M.; Benjamin D. Goodman (wife Mary), of Southlake, Texas; Robert P. Goodman (wife Valerie), of Pagosa Springs; and six grandchildren: Nikki L.

													<span class="body"><font size="2">Dopha “Mildred” Levac, 89, passed away early Friday morning, June 20, 2008, at Coulee Community Hospital Nursing Home. She was born Nov. 4, 1918, to George Earl and Josie Belle Kingsley of Pagosa Springs, Colo. She grew up on a ranch and attended a one-room country school in Archuleta County, Colo., with her brothers and sisters.<br>
														</font></span>
													<p><span class="body"><font size="2">She came to Grand Coulee in September 1942 with her first husband, George Crawford, Sr., and his son, George “Sonny” Crawford, Jr. They lived briefly in the Rose Bowl Cabins, dirt floors and all. Soon they moved to a modest rental house where they lived for nearly two years. Even though she thought Grand Coulee was the end of the earth, good friends assured her if she stayed six months, the place would grow on her, which proved true. At the end of WW II, she and George settled next door in their own home on King Street. Four years later, daughter Linda was born.<br>
															</font></span></p>
													<p><span class="body"><font size="2">After her husband’s death in 1950, she chose to stay in Grand Coulee. She married Lionel “Leo” Levac of Massena, N.Y. in Coeur D’Alene, Idaho, on Aug. 4, 1951. They had two daughters, Pamela and Teresa.<br>
															</font></span></p>
													<p><span class="body"><font size="2">Mildred’s life revolved around her family. She was a devoted mother who always knew where her children were and with whom they were spending their time. She was a dedicated room mother at the school, active in the PTA, Girl Scouts, and the Federated Women’s Club. She enjoyed visiting with her friends and family around the kitchen table. For her, the leading edge of technology was a new suds-saver washing machine, an electric iron, and a dial telephone without a party line.<br>
															</font></span></p>
													<p><span class="body"><font size="2">She is survived by her husband Leo; three daughters: Linda (Richard) Black of Grand Coulee, Wash., Pamela Levac of Chino, Calif., Teresa (Mark) Nash of Spanaway, Wash.; five grandchildren, Douglas (Dawn), Steven (Semine), Amanda, and Joseph Nash of Spanaway, Wash.; Michelle (Scott) Savage of Chino, Calif.; four great grandchildren, Ashley and Anne Nash, and Chloe and Jacob (due in August) Savage. Numerous nieces and nephews also survive her. All nine of her siblings and her stepson, George Crawford, Jr., preceded her in death.<br>

Dave is survived by his wife, Lili; brothers Burke, Michael and Brian; daughters Terri and Sandy, son Edward and three nieces, Leslie, Natalie and Carolyn. Dave was born Nov. 1, 1938, in Ord, Nebraska. He attended school in three states and graduated from Rose Hill High School in Portland, Oregon. He enjoyed being in the National Guard but did not want to make it his career. He worked for several small airlines on the west coast. In 1960, Dave applied and was hired by United Airlines where he spent the majority of his career working at the Flight Simulator Department in Flight Simulator Maintenance in Denver. Almost every weekend, days off were spent heading to the mountains four wheeling in his beloved Scout and hiking, photography and enjoying the beautiful scenery. He moved to Pagosa Springs in 1997 and spent several months commuting between Pagosa Springs and Denver. In 1998, after 38 years-plus, Mr. David opted for retirement to live out his dreams of hiking, fishing, photography, reading, listening to music, discussions with friends on the subject of politics and history. But, let’s not forget Dave loved being around the ladies.<br>

												<p><font size="2">The Archuleta County Sheriff’s Office and various stakeholders are presenting the plan for approval during the public hearing section of the Archuleta County Board of County Commissioners’ meeting , at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday, June 24. This presentation will take place near the start of the meeting, to be held in the commission meeting room at the county courthouse.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">In response to wildland fires in 2000 and 2002, the U.S. Congress authorized the National Fire Plan in 2000 and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA) in 2003. Under this legislation, local communities are encouraged to develop and implement forest management plans and hazardous fuel reduction projects. U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of land Management are directed by HFRA to give consideration to the priorities of local communities as they develop and implement these plans. </font></p>
												<p><font size="2">In Archuleta County, this process started in 2001 with numerous participants developing the Community Fire Plan. This plan, developed as a component of the National Fire Plan, identified wildland fire risk areas and developed goals and action recommendations throughout Archuleta County. Five counties in southwest Colorado, including Archuleta County, unveiled Community Fire Plans, which collectively are considered national models for collaboration, and for intergovernmental planning and action around wildland fire education and emergency response. </font></p>
												<p><font size="2">The Archuleta County CWPP complements and builds upon the Community Fire Plan. It incorporates key principles and guidelines arising from the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. It is intended as an over arching document for the county, with the hope that individual communities will create CWPPs that are specific to their areas. The plan lays out an ambitious program for:</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">• Reducing wildland fire risk in the wildland-urban interface (WUI).</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">• Accomplishing important fuel treatments on federal and private lands. </font></p>
												<p><font size="2">• Reducing structural ignitability.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">• Increasing community safety.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">• Continuing successful education and community mobilization endeavors.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">• Continuing to enhancing partnerships between federal, state and local agencies and among community organizations and local governments.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">The plan also sets the Archuleta County WUI definition and defines Archuleta County’s Communities of Concern..</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">The draft plan is available at www.archuletacounty.org/oem/. </font></p>

													</font></span>
												<p><span class="body"><font size="2">In order to participate in the hearing, LPEA customers must notify LPEA by July 30, in writing, of their intention to do so and of the nature of their presentation.<br>
														</font></span></p>
												<p><span class="body"><font size="2">Community members are invited to comment on the three new standards to be considered by LPEA, but only those who file a request to participate by July 30, 2008, will be permitted to present information at the public hearing.<br>
														</font></span></p>
												<p><span class="body"><font size="2">“While La Plata Electric is a rural cooperative overseen by a board of directors, various aspects are also regulated by the state and federal governments,” said Greg Munro, LPEA CEO, citing PURPA and the new EAct 2007 as examples. “We must adhere to their requirements.”<br>
														</font></span></p>
												<p><span class="body"><font size="2">LPEA and similar utility companies are required to consider adoption of the three new PURPA standards. The law does not, however, specify that utilities must adopt them.<br>
														</font></span></p>
												<p><span class="body"><font size="2">The three PURPA standards under consideration and open to comment by LPEA member/customers are: 1)&nbsp; the inclusion of energy efficiency into integrated resource plans; 2) the alignment of electric rates with the delivery of cost-effective energy efficiency as well as the promotion of energy efficiency investments; and, 3) the daily provision of direct written or electronic access to information concerning time-based electricity prices to all customers and information regarding the sources of power used, including greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;<br>
														</font></span></p>
												<p><span class="body"><font size="2">“This third consideration applies directly to Tri-State Generation &amp; Transmission,” said Munro, reminding that LPEA is a distribution cooperative and&nbsp;purchases its full&nbsp;wholesale power requirements from Tri-State under a long-term, all-requirements contract. “LPEA does not directly own or control any generation resources, so we will look to Tri-State for their response to this PURPA standard. Member/customers may provide us comment on the third standard, which we will pass on directly to Tri-State.”<br>
														</font></span></p>
												<p><span class="body"><font size="2">All LPEA customers are eligible to participate, but must notify LPEA in writing by mail, fax or e-mail by July 30. The notification must indicate name and address of the person requesting to participate; whether the person desires to make an oral presentation and if so, the anticipated length; and whether any special accommodations need to be made for the presenter. Written testimony or comments must be submitted to LPEA by Sept. 30, 2008, for consideration at the hearing.<br>
														</font></span></p>
												<p><span class="body"><font size="2">A complete copy of the legislative language relevant to the PURPA standards is posted on LPEA’s Web site at www.lpea.coop. Any LPEA customer not able to access this web site and who desires a copy of the legislative language or testimonies should contact LPEA at 247-5786, by mail at P.O. Box 2750, Durango, CO 81302, or e-mail at purpa@lpea.coop, and a copy will be provided at cost.&nbsp;<br>
														</font></span></p>
												<p><span class="body"><font size="2">Determination of the standards is expected to be rendered on or before Nov. 19, 2008. For further information, contact LPEA at 247-5786.<br>

													It’s spring. Time to hunt, time to eat. This bobcat sat on a rock in a garden at a Pagosa Country residence last week, watching her young cub attempt to find and fell prey nearby. Local residents are reminded to remove potential food sources from accessible spots on their properties — foods favored by a variety of wild creatures, including bears.<br>

												<p><span class="body"><font size="2">Under a cooperative agreement between the U.S. Forest Service, Archuleta County and the Mill Creek Road Association of private landowners in the area, the Mill Creek Road (National Forest System Road No. 662) will be upgraded and transferred to county jurisdiction this summer. <br>
														</font></span></p>
												<p><font size="2"><span>Construction will take place on about three miles of the road. The project is expected to begin later this week and continue at least through early July.<br>
														</span></font></p>
												<p><span class="body"><font size="2">The road will remain open during the project, but motorists may experience short delays.<br>
														</font></span></p>
												<p><span class="body"><font size="2">The first part of the project will entail installing retaining walls to stabilize slopes and stream banks affected by the road to prevent further erosion into Mill Creek. In addition, culverts will be installed to improve cross drainage. After this phase is completed, the road width and surface will be rebuilt to county standards.<br>
														</font></span></p>
												<p><span class="body"><font size="2">“The cooperation with the county and local landowners has been invaluable in bringing about a solution to the issue of providing access to private property owners in this area,” said Kevin Khung, Pagosa District Ranger anf field office manager.<br>

												<p><font size="2">An Archuleta County sheriff’s deputy picked up the remaining suspect in a drug distribution sting operation who remained at large following a raid on two area homes Sunday that netted seven arrests, three vehicles, cash, and drug packaging and distribution material.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">Archuleta County Undersheriff and Public Information Officer John Weiss said Edward Crider, age 57, of Pagosa Springs, was arrested yesterday on suspicion of distribution of a controlled substance and could face Class 3 felony charges.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">Weiss said Crider is one of eight suspects law enforcement officers obtained arrest warrants for on allegations of distribution of a controlled substance.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">With the eighth arrest, Weiss said the thrust of Sunday’s operation is complete, however he added that local law enforcement is not dropping its guard.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">“The big message is, ‘We’re not done yet; this wasn’t a one time deal,” Weiss said.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">Weiss said the raid was the result of a 10-month interagency investigation led by Detective T.J. Fitzwater, a joint town and county narcotics officer.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">Although sheriff’s department staff would not comment on the amount of drugs seized during the operation, Weiss said buys of nearly 100 grams of methamphetamine and cocaine led to authorities obtaining eight arrest and two search warrants.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">Weiss said asset forfeiture proceedings are pending against three properties in the Pagosa Springs area. </font></p>
												<p><font size="2">According to Weiss, the operation began about 5:30 a.m. Sunday morning when search and arrest warrants were executed at 116 Nutria Circle in Aspen Springs and at 354 Canyon Circle in the Vista subdivision.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">Weiss said the operation was a joint effort between the Archuleta County Sheriff’s Department and the Pagosa Springs Police Department. In addition, the Ignacio Police Department provided a narcotics canine, firefighters from the Pagosa Fire Protection District checked the houses for hazardous materials and Upper San Juan Health Service District emergency medical services personnel were on standby during the operation.</font></p>

												<p><font size="2">Weiss said all the suspects are from Pagosa Springs, and all could face Class 3 felony charges, except Bradley, who could face Class 2 felony charges. </font></p>
												<p><font size="2">The operation began about 5:30 a.m. Sunday morning when search and arrest warrants were executed at 116 Nutria Circle in Aspen Springs and tactical and arrest teams raided the home. The operation yielded three of the suspects in question and one vehicle.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">About 6 a.m. a tactical team entered a home at 354 Canyon Circle, in the Vista Subdivision, and took another of the seven suspects into custody.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">Search teams then combed each residence for evidence.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">Weiss said the search teams recovered drugs, packaging and distribution material, drug paraphernalia and cash.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">Weiss said the tactical team and arrest teams later apprehended three of the remaining four suspects.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">According to Weiss, the operation was a joint effort between the Archuleta County Sheriff’s Department and the Pagosa Springs Police Department. In addition, the Ignacio Police Department provided a narcotics canine, firefighters from the Pagosa Fire Protection District checked the houses for hazardous materials and Upper San Juan Health Service District emergency medical services personnel were on standby during the operation.</font></p>
												<p><font size="2">“Chief Volger and I wanted these investigations to be as thorough and professional as possible and the results could not have been better,” said Archuleta County Sheriff Pete Gonzalez. “We hope this sends a message to anyone who may want to sell illegal drugs in our community.” <br>

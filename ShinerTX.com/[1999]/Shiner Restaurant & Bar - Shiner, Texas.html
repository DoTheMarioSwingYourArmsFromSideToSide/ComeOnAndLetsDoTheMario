Elegant Dining Room
</b>
<br>
<br>
The spacious Dining Room, which seats 64 guests, is elegantly appointed in warm 
green and gold. Once a local pharmacy, it is filled with beautiful cherry wood 
cabinets. Inside the showcases is a treasure-trove of local Texas history, 
including relics from the Half Moon Post Office, the Indians, Texas Rangers, 
the Wagner Hospital, Kaspar Wire Works, the Civil War, Texas Independence and 
World War II.
<br>
<br>
Remembered are heroes and scoundrels, villains and men of honor. Items 
are both tribute and memorial to the past: Shiner National Bank and Civil War 
currency, Shiner's four major league baseball players, guns and hatchets, 
knives and swords, saddles and Bowie knives. Another large glass case contains 
a cornucopia of "old West" curios such as spurs, pistols, knives, bugle, 
rattlesnake, barb wire, leggings and more.

Historic Bar
</b>
<br>
<br>
The Historic Bar features a massive two-piece cherry wood bar, restored to its
original splendor as testament to the grandeur of the era. It is one of the 
oldest bars still in existence in Texas. William Green, the building's original
owner was a local character, remembered in part for making sure that buckets 
on the floor of the bar were full of beer for his horse when he rode inside
 -- and for the big kegs of root beer gracing the bar during prohibition.
<br>
<br>
Where once all the important citizens of Shiner gathered in the bar for smokes 
and spirits, we invite you to enjoy your favorite beverage and enjoy the 
historic atmosphere. In addition to mixed drinks, beer, and wine, we are 
pleased to serve 45 guests in the bar from our full dining menu.

Spacious Banquet Room
</b>
<br>
<br>
The area that once was the meat market is now the banquet room, which seats
150 guests, with plenty of room for entertainment. The old barbecue pits are 
still in the back room. 
<br>
<br>
The building, 88 years old and still going strong, is a dedication to past, 
present and future. "Some people go and recreate history, but we don't have to 
- it's already here."

A Brief Shiner History
</b>
<br>
<br>
In the valley between the Lavaca and Guadalupe rivers, it began as an Indian 
settlement called "Half Moon." It was a place of ranchers and cattle, the 
railroad and Indians, outlaws and Texas Rangers -- and cotton was "King." Texas 
roots run deep in Shiner, Texas. 
<br>
<br>
George West, one of the first to drive cattle in this part of Texas, was 
married to a Shiner - and Henry B. Shiner donated the land for the town of 
Shiner to have its start in 1887. 
<br>
<br>
William Green was an entrepreneur with interests in ranching, cotton, cattle 
and land development. In Wilson County, he purchased tracts of land, subdivided 
them and then sold smaller tracts. One of the first millionaires in the area, 
he and his wife Julia Dickson Green moved to Shiner in 1890, and the story goes 
that he had alligators in a pond in front of his house to keep unwanted guests 
away. Green was also the man who drove 500 horses from Shiner to San Antonio 
for Teddy Roosevelt and the RoughRiders. 
<br>
<br>
In 1911, Green erected a 16,000 square-foot, two-story building on the main 
street. At the time, Shiner was peppered with bars - 31 by one account. And 
Green added the Palace Bar to the list. The bar was the hub of the town's 
activity, and with its rich, gleaming cherry wood furnishings, it was quite 
elegant for the time. Trading, deal making and business were conducted in the 
bar. The favored dish of the day was the "highball" - a concoction of half 
chili and half stew. 
<br>
<br>
A pharmacy shared the downstairs area with the bar, and it sported lavish, 
ornate cherry wood 70-foot built-in cabinets with drawers and leaded glass. The 
second floor held Green's office, his grandson's office and offices for 
architects and doctors. 
<br>
<br>
The original hospital for Shiner was on the second floor, with an impressive 
skylight in the roof for the surgery. One of the doctors commented that if a 
person could climb the stairs (28 steep, narrow ones), they weren't that sick.

<b>
Texas Preservation Award
</b>
<br>
<br>
In the '40s, Dickson Green sold the building to Hugo and Kamila Schwabe, who 
then sold it to Jimmy Mikes. In 1996, Russell and Roxanne Boothe purchased the 
building and have tried to restore it to its original distinction without 
changing any more than necessary. All of the wood -- ceilings and floors -- is 
the original. The Boothes changed the casual cafe and bar into a fine dining 
establishment, the Shiner Restaurant and Bar. 
<br>
<br>
Texas First Lady Laura Bush visited Shiner in 1998 as part of a Main Street 
Program promotion. As she drove through downtown, she noticed the Green 
Building and suggested it be nominated as a historic site. And in 1999, the 
Boothes received the "Preservation Texas Clara Driscoll Award of Merit" for 
their preservation work on the Green Building. Local craftsmen and merchants 
who participated in the restoration project share the pride and recognition of 
this prestigious award.
